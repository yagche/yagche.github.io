## Saturday Night Live

### S49E12


"Saturday Night Live" (SNL) is a long-running American late-night live television sketch comedy and variety show. It has been on the air since 1975 and has featured a rotating cast of comedians, actors, and musicians performing sketches, parodying current events, and hosting musical guests. SNL has become known for its satirical humor and political commentary, and it has launched the careers of numerous comedians and actors. Each episode typically features a celebrity host and a musical guest.
The S49E12 episode is hosted by Shane Gillis. Shane Gillis is a stand-up comedian who gained attention when he was announced as one of the new cast members of "Saturday Night Live" for its 45th season in 2019. However, shortly after the announcement, controversial remarks made by Gillis in the past surfaced, leading to public backlash. These remarks, which included racial slurs and derogatory language, prompted SNL to dismiss Gillis from the show before he even appeared in a single episode. The incident sparked discussions about accountability and representation in comedy. Since then, Gillis has continued his career as a stand-up comedian and podcast host. Now Gillis is officially hosting the show.
